                  <p>Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American entrepreneur, inventor,
                        business magnate, media proprietor, and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of
                        Apple; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar ; a member of The Walt Disney Company's
                        board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of
                        NeXT. He is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and
                        1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Born in
                        San Francisco to a Syrian father and a German-American mother, Jobs was adopted shortly after
                        his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year, and traveled
                        through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded
                        Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the first highly
                        successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in
                        1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the
                        development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in
                        1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop
                        publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer
                        to feature vector graphics. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle
                        with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley.</p>
